# First and Third Project

This actually was fun project I like this much more than reordering an array or asking me the difference between "==" and "==="

# What I did

Kept it pretty simple but I did add some libraries for the dropdown - [Select2](https://select2.org/) and a carousel - [Slick Slider](http://kenwheeler.github.io/slick/), Think makes a little easier on the eyes and it only took a few minutes to get running

Liquid and `cart/add.js` was all pretty standard I did add Jquery for the for the slider and dropdown so I figured I'd do it the old Jquery Ajax way for add to cart, Hopefully that's alright.

# What I could have done

I probably could have added some lazloading to the images so they don't flicker, added a few more transitions and used a little more vanilla JS but I didn't want to spend too much time on this.

# Issues

The liquid money filter wasn't working for me so I just divided it by 100 since there weren't any cents in the price.
